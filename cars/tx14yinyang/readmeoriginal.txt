Car Description
================================================================
The real car is going to have 1001 hp engine and will top out at
404 kph (!) which are about like 252.5 mph. So you bet right if
you think we made it fast as well. Its just in the SuperPro
range of the cars. Handling is very stable but not too quick at
the responding part. Great fun to chase other cars around
faster tracks with this one.

Thanks And Accolades
================================================================

We want to thank you, for downloading this car, and supporting
the Re-Volt community with dlding it. Then we gotta thank the
whole RV community, too. Its probably the best community on a
racing game all around the web, and it's hard work to get there.
Now we all have to work even harder to keep it there! Thanks
and: Keep it up!

We want to thank Wayne LeMonds, for his great site and forum. If
it Wayne would not have been here, you would possibly not read
this, cuz we never would have gone so deep into Re-Volt without
the forum. Thanks a whole bunch, Wayne! If you havn't visited
his website please do so, you won't regret it.

We want to thank the whole staff of RVA for their great site. It
is the perfect addition to Racerspoint and will be (or probably
is already) the completest Re-Volt site on the web, with all the
cars, tracks, tutorial, tools etc. If you don't know it yet, you
really have to hurry to get there: http://www.rvarchive.com/

We would also like to thank ALL the peeps at #re-volt chat on
the IRC austnet servers for their support and help without
forgetting anyone of them. Thanks dudes!

Then we want to thank all the creators of the tools we used.
Without their hard work, this car would not have been possible.

Individual Thanks On This Car
================================================================
Slightly Askew:
For his great LEGO track "Crossfire MKII" which has some great
flow and some cool textures. We took the screenshots on this
one and we think they look great. Thanks!

Ryuji Kainoh:
We can't stop thanking him for producing those great cars for
NFS4. Its always fun to convert em and finally see em driving
around in Re-Volt. They just look so damn-what realistic. We
won't stop to convert 'em as well. Thanks!
