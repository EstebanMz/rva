Car Description
================================================================
The most-selled car in Germany for the last lot of years. We
don't think it'll be one of the most downloaded for Re-Volt tho.
We don't even like the real car. But we thought it's our effin
duty as Germans to release the most-selled German car. Wow!
Have fun if you can!

Thanks And Accolades
================================================================
We want to thank you, for downloading this car, and supporting
the Re-Volt community with dlding it. Then we gotta thank the
whole RV community, too. Its probably the best community on a
racing game all around the web, and it's hard work to get there.
Now we all have to work even harder to keep it there! Thanks
and: Keep it up!

We want to thank Wayne LeMonds, for his great site and forum. If
it Wayne would not have been here, you would possibly not read
this, cuz we never would have gone so deep into Re-Volt without
the forum. Thanks a whole bunch, Wayne! If you havn't visited
his website please do so, you won't regret it.

We want to thank the whole staff of RVA for their great site. It
is the perfect addition to Racerspoint and will be (or probably
is already) the completest Re-Volt site on the web, with all the
cars, tracks, tutorial, tools etc. If you don't know it yet, you
really have to hurry to get there: http://www.rvarchive.com/

We would also like to thank ALL the peeps at #revolt-chat on
the IRC austnet servers for their support and help without
forgetting anyone of them. Thanks dudes!

Then we want to thank all the creators of the tools we used.
Without their hard work, this car would not have been possible.
