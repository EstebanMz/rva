Description
-----------------
Another car to join the family of funky rear-wheel-drive cars alongside Cerveth and Steezy.

Low top speed, high acceleration, four-wheel steering makes it a twitchy, agile, yet capable fighter for the class in the right hands.

Requirements
-----------------
You MUST use the latest RVGL patch for the textures to display properly.
