## Introduction

Each of the folders in this repository contain the files for the content used by the Re-Volt America community, 
and they are to be kept within a single folder, `rva/` in the example beneath. This folder we refer to as the
RVA Pack.

```
rva/
├── cars/
├── levels/
└── gfx/
```

Then, the RVA pack can be dropped into your Re-Volt installation's `packs/` directory, and loaded in by
either creating a `default.txt` within said location. In order to include the pack, simply write the following in it:

```
;default
rva
;local *
```
